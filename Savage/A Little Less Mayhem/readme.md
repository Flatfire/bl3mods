### Description
Sometimes you just don't want the floor to be lava and want to fight god the old fashioned way. 
This hotfix removes all mayhem modifiers by way of setting their weights to 0 in order to guarantee they never show up. By default though, this hotfix doesn't discriminate and will leave you with just a clean way to scale the sponginess of enemies once you're in the endgame.
